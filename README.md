A [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) terminal UI for [mkpfs](https://pypi.org/project/mkpfs/) —
**pack, inspect, verify, tree, unpack, build raw dumps to exFAT, and deploy to a jailbroken PS5 over FTP** from a single sidebar-driven app. Every
operation has its own view with file/directory pickers, live progress, and a result panel that surfaces
warnings and errors without ever leaving the terminal.

> mkpfs-tui is a third-party frontend. It pins `mkpfs` as a dependency and never modifies it.

## Operations

| Operation | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Pack**       | Build a PFS image from a source **folder** or **file** (compression, signing, encryption, dry-run). |
| **Inspect**    | Show an image's header, inode/dir/file counts, sizes, and checksums in a table. |
| **Verify**     | Validate an image's structure and checksums — optionally against a source tree or expected CRC32 / manifest. |
| **Tree**       | Browse the file tree stored inside an image. |
| **Unpack**     | Extract an image to a target directory, with progress and a files/dirs/bytes summary. |
| **Build exFAT** | Turn a PS5 dump folder into a `.exfat` image for ShadowMountPlus — adaptive cluster, param.json-derived name/label. |
| **Deploy**      | Push a built image (or any file) to a jailbroken PS5 over FTP — live progress, remote listing, overwrite confirm. |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or newer** (only needed for the `uvx`/`pipx` install; the Linux binary bundles its own).
- A terminal that renders modern TUIs. Most do; on Windows use **Windows Terminal** (the default on Windows 11),
  not the legacy console.
- `mkpfs` is installed automatically as a dependency — you do not install it yourself.
- **Build exFAT only:** `exfatprogs` and `rsync` must be installed on the host system, and the build step
  requires `sudo` access for the loop-mount copy (`sudo mount`). These are not needed for any other operation.

---

## Install

> Prefer a self-contained download? Grab a build from the
> [Releases](https://github.com/TinyBacklog/mkpfs-tui/releases) page.

The cross-platform way is via Python, using either [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended —
`uvx` runs it without installing) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) (installs the `mkpfs-tui` command).

### Linux

```bash
# Prerequisite — uv (one line, no root):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Run it (downloads + runs in an isolated env, nothing to clean up):
uvx mkpfs-tui
```

Or with pipx — `sudo apt install pipx` (Debian/Ubuntu) / `sudo pacman -S python-pipx` (Arch), then:

```bash
pipx ensurepath        # once, then restart the shell
pipx install mkpfs-tui
mkpfs-tui
```

**No Python?** Download `mkpfs-tui-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/TinyBacklog/mkpfs-tui/releases) page, then:

```bash
tar -xzf mkpfs-tui-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./mkpfs-tui/mkpfs-tui
```

### macOS

```bash
# Prerequisite — uv (via Homebrew or the install script):
brew install uv          # or: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

uvx mkpfs-tui
```

Or with pipx: `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`, then `pipx install mkpfs-tui`.
*(No prebuilt macOS binary yet — use the Python install above.)*

### Windows

Use **Windows Terminal** for a TUI. In PowerShell:

```powershell
# Prerequisite — uv:
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  # or: powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

uvx mkpfs-tui
```

Or with pipx: `py -m pip install --user pipx`, then `py -m pipx ensurepath` (restart the terminal) and
`pipx install mkpfs-tui`. *(No prebuilt Windows binary yet — use the Python install above.)*

---

## Usage

Launch the app (`uvx mkpfs-tui`, or `mkpfs-tui` if installed). You land on the **Pack** view.

### The interface

- **Left sidebar** — the seven operations. Move with `↑`/`↓`; the right pane switches as you go.
- **Right pane** — the selected operation's form, run button, progress, and a result panel
  (errors in red, warnings in amber, success in green).
- **Browse…** buttons open a file/directory picker — navigate with the arrows, **Choose** to accept,
  **Cancel**/`Escape` to dismiss. You can also just type a path into the field.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Move in the sidebar / lists / tree |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Move between form fields |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Activate the focused button / switch |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette — includes **theme switching** |
| `Escape` | Close a modal (picker / overwrite prompt) |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

### By operation

- **Pack** — choose **Folder** or **File** mode, pick the **Source** and the **Output image** path (the
  image is written *exactly* to the path you type — include the extension you want), then set options:
  PS4/PS5 version, inode width (folder mode only), compression level, CPU count, block size, and the
  switches (Compress, Case-insensitive, Signed, Encrypted, Dry run, Verify after). Press **Pack** to watch a
  live progress bar; **Cancel** stops the build. If the output already exists you'll be asked to confirm
  before it's overwritten.
- **Inspect** — point at an **Image** and press **Inspect**; the table fills with version, sizes, counts,
  and checksums.
- **Verify** — give an **Image** and, optionally, a **Source** directory and/or an expected CRC32 / manifest
  SHA-256, then press **Verify** for a **PASS/FAIL** banner plus any errors.
- **Tree** — pick an **Image** and press **Build tree** to browse its contents.
- **Unpack** — pick an **Image** and an **Output directory** and press **Unpack**. Turn on **Overwrite** to
  clear a non-empty output directory first (you'll be asked to confirm the deletion).
- **Build exFAT** — pick a **Dump folder** (a PS5 game dump directory) and an **Output** path, then press
  **Build**. The app reads `param.json` inside the dump to suggest the output filename and the exFAT volume
  label; you can override both. Use a **Preset** (PPSA / +Title / +Version) and the **Lowercase** toggle to
  control the suggested filename. Choose a cluster size or leave it on **Auto** (adaptive). Tick **Verify after**
  to run `fsck.exfat` on the finished image. Tick **Deploy after** to push the finished image to the PS5
  immediately (requires FTP host set in the Deploy view or config). The pipeline is: `truncate` → `mkfs.exfat`
  → `sudo mount` (loop) → `rsync` → `umount` → optional `fsck.exfat`. ShadowMountPlus keys off the `.exfat`
  filename, and all game files are placed at the image root. Requires `exfatprogs` + `rsync` on the host; the
  mount step needs `sudo`.
- **Deploy** — fill in the **Host** (and optionally **Port**, **Path**, **User**, **Remote name**) then press
  **List** to browse the remote directory or **Deploy** to upload. Settings persist to
  `~/.config/mkpfs-tui/config.toml` (password is never stored). FTP is plain (no TLS) — intended for LAN use
  with a jailbreak payload running on the console; the console mounts game images itself via ShadowMountPlus.

### Encrypted images

Every view has an **EKPFS key** field (64 hex characters) and a **newCrypt** switch for encrypted images;
leave them blank/off for unencrypted ones. In Pack, the key is only applied when **Encrypted** is on.

---

## Build exFAT

The `build-exfat` subcommand exposes the same pipeline as the TUI view for scripting:

```bash
mkpfs-tui build-exfat <dump> [-o out.exfat] [--cluster auto|32K|64K|128K|256K|512K|1M] \
    [--label LABEL] [--preset ppsa|title|version] [--lower] [--no-verify] [--deploy]
```

- `<dump>` — path to the PS5 dump folder (must contain `sce_sys/param.json`).
- `-o` / `--output` — path for the `.exfat` image to create (auto-derived from `param.json` if omitted).
- `--cluster` — exFAT cluster size; default `auto` chooses adaptively based on the dump size.
- `--label` — override the volume label (auto-derived from `param.json` if omitted).
- `--preset` — filename preset: `ppsa` (PPSA code only), `title` (title only), or `version` (title + version, default).
- `--lower` — lowercase the suggested filename.
- `--no-verify` — skip the `fsck.exfat` check after building.
- `--deploy` — push the finished image to the PS5 over FTP immediately after building (uses the FTP config from `~/.config/mkpfs-tui/config.toml`; requires `--host` if no config is saved).

**Runtime requirements:** `exfatprogs` (provides `mkfs.exfat` + `fsck.exfat`) and `rsync` must be installed.
The copy step mounts the image via a loop device — `sudo` is required for that step. The output `.exfat`
filename is what ShadowMountPlus uses to identify the title; all game files are placed at the image root.

---

## Deploy to PS5

mkpfs-tui can push a file (typically the `.exfat` image you just built) to a jailbroken PS5 running an FTP
server (such as the etaHEN payload) over a plain LAN FTP connection. FTP is not encrypted — this is intended
for local network use only. The console mounts game images itself via ShadowMountPlus; mkpfs-tui only handles
the upload side.

### Standalone Deploy view

Open the **Deploy** view from the sidebar, fill in:

- **Host** — IP address of your PS5.
- **Port** — FTP port (default **2121**, the etaHEN default).
- **Path** — remote directory to upload into (default **`/data/etaHEN/games/`**).
- **User** — FTP username (default `anonymous`).
- **File** — local file to upload.
- **Remote name** — filename on the console (defaults to the local filename).

Press **List** to browse the remote directory. Press **Deploy** to upload with a live progress bar. If a file
with the same name already exists on the console you'll be asked to confirm before overwriting. Settings
(host / port / path / user) are saved to `~/.config/mkpfs-tui/config.toml` — the password is never stored.

### `deploy` CLI

```bash
mkpfs-tui deploy <file> --host <PS5-IP> [--port 2121] [--path /data/etaHEN/games/] \
    [--user anonymous] [--name remote-filename.exfat]
```

- `<file>` — local file to push.
- `--host` — PS5 IP address (required if no host is saved in the config).
- `--port` — FTP port (default 2121).
- `--path` — remote directory (default `/data/etaHEN/games/`).
- `--user` — FTP username (default `anonymous`); enter the password interactively when prompted.
- `--name` — override the remote filename (defaults to the local filename).

### Inline deploy after build

In the **Build exFAT** view, tick **Deploy after** to push the finished image to the PS5 immediately after
the build completes. The same FTP settings apply (loaded from config, or entered in the Deploy view first).
The `build-exfat --deploy` CLI flag does the same for scripted workflows.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. The project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for everything.

### Set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TinyBacklog/mkpfs-tui
cd mkpfs-tui
uv sync                                              # creates .venv with deps + dev tools
uv run textual run --dev mkpfs_tui.app:MkpfsTuiApp   # run the app (or: uv run python -m mkpfs_tui)
```

Tip: run `uv run textual console` in a second pane to see logs/tracebacks from the `--dev` app.

### Test & lint

```bash
./run-tests.sh        # ruff format + ruff check --fix + pytest (what to run before committing)
uv run pytest         # tests only
```

Tests use Textual's `App.run_test()` Pilot harness with `pytest-asyncio` in auto mode. CI runs
lint + tests (check-mode) on every push and PR.

### Conventions

- **`uv` only** — `uv sync`, `uv run …`; never `pip` or a global Python.
- Type hints everywhere, **Google-style docstrings**, `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of
  every module, prefer `X | None` over `Optional`. **ruff is law** (config in `pyproject.toml`).
- **The mkpfs boundary (most important rule):** all imports of and calls to `mkpfs.*` live in the single
  module **`mkpfs_tui/mkpfs_runner.py`**, which exposes the app's own value types. No other module imports
  mkpfs. When you depend on new mkpfs surface, add an assertion to `tests/test_mkpfs_contract.py` so an
  upstream change fails loudly.
- **Updating the pinned mkpfs:** `uv lock --upgrade-package mkpfs`, run the tests (including the contract
  test), then commit.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for release history. The architecture and the per-milestone build plans
are kept outside the repo (in the author's planning notes).
